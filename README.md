Handle collisions using open addressing with quadratic probing.
Resize the hash table when the load factor exceeds 0.8 to maintain efficiency.
The system should efficiently handle a large number of contacts and provide fast lookup, insertion, and deletion operations by ensuring the followings:

Handle collisions using open addressing with quadratic probing.
Resize the hash table when the load factor exceeds 0.8 to maintain efficiency.
